She wanted to overturn a law from Texas that made abortion illegal unless it was performed on doctor's orders to save a woman's life. She claimed in her case that the state laws violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments since they were overly vague and limited her right to personal privacy.")

Jackson Women's Health Organization case from June 2022. The ruling had invalidated the long-standing right to an abortion guaranteed by the Constitution and eliminated the government restrictions on abortion access set down in the earlier instances of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Therefore, states have created their own regulations about protecting or restricting abortion.")

In another group of states, they do not have any explicit laws regarding abortion protection nor prohibiting abortion, and access to services are mixed in these states.")
